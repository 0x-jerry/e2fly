## Migration

**`< 1.6.0` to `1.6.0`**

Because version `1.6.0` changed the app’s identifier, all configuration files need to be migrated manually.

You need to open the configuration folder before upgrading. Then upgrade the app to `1.6.0`. After the upgrade, you can copy all the files to the new configuration folder.

## Contribute

Any kinds of contribution are welcome.
